# The 60-Day “Learn for You” Challenge

## What This Is

For 60 days, each participant gives themselves intentional time to learn something they genuinely care about.

This challenge is about **personal growth**, not productivity theater.

No pressure.
No perfection.
No performance.

Just showing up for yourself.

## The Intention

> **What happens if I invest time in learning—because I want to—not because I have to?**

This is not:

* A grind
* A streak contest
* A content obligation
* A test of discipline

This *is*:

* Curiosity
* Momentum
* Quiet progress
* Rebuilding a habit of learning

---

## The Only Real Commitment

* Aim for **about one hour a day**
* The time should be **intentional**
* Some days may be shorter
* Some days may go longer

If you showed up with purpose, it counts.

---

## Topic Choice

* Choose **one topic** you’re excited about
* You’re allowed to:

  * Explore subtopics
  * Follow curiosity
  * Adjust direction within the same general theme

If it still feels meaningful to *you*, it’s valid.

---

## Pace & Flexibility

* Life happens
* Learning is not a checklist

**Recommended:**

* 1–2 guilt-free days per week
* No tracking, no explanations, no “making it up later”

The goal is sustainability, not pressure.

---

## Accountability (Optional & Supportive)

This challenge runs on **trust and shared encouragement**, not enforcement.

* No daily check-ins required
* No logs are mandatory
* No one is policing time spent

If you want to share, keep it light:

* “This finally clicked today.”
* “I went down a cool rabbit hole.”
* “I’m enjoying this more than I expected.”

Silence is also acceptable.

---

## Sharing Options (Choose What Feels Right)

* **Quiet Mode:** Learn privately, no output
* **Light Notes:** Personal scratchpad or journal
* **Creative Output:** Blog, GitHub, demos—*only if it adds joy*

Nothing is required beyond learning itself.

---

## What Success Looks Like

You succeed if:

* You feel closer to your topic than you did before
* You want to keep learning after Day 60
* You proved to yourself that learning can feel good again

There is no failure state.

---

## Group Agreement

By participating, we agree to:

* Respect personal pace
* Encourage curiosity
* Avoid comparison
* Keep this human

---

## One-Line Summary

> **For 60 days, I’m giving myself permission to learn—without pressure, performance, or perfection.**
